# API Requirements

## API Endpoints

**Base path:** every route below is served under `/api/v1` — e.g. `POST /api/v1/auth/login`. The tables leave the prefix out for readability. Only `GET /` (liveness), `GET /healthz` (readiness — checks the database), `GET /docs` and
`GET /openapi.yaml` sit outside it; any other unknown path answers `404` with the envelope.

**Envelope:** every response is `{ status, message, data }`, and an error adds a machine-readable `code` (`invalid_request`, `no_token`, `token_expired`, `token_invalid`, `invalid_credentials`, `forbidden`, `not_found`, `conflict`, `rate_limited`, `internal_error`).

**Pagination:** list routes marked *paginated* accept `?limit=` (1–100, default 50) and `?offset=` (default 0), and add a `meta` object next to `data`:

```json
{ "status": 200, "message": "Products fetched.", "data": [ ... ], "meta": { "limit": 50, "offset": 0, "total": 134 } }
```

**Money:** `price`, `unitPrice` and `total` are `NUMERIC` columns, which the driver returns as strings (`"19.99"`) so no decimal is lost.

**Passwords:** every route that sets a password requires at least 8 characters and stores it exactly as typed — surrounding spaces are not trimmed.

**Errors from the database:** a value Postgres rejects is the client's mistake, so it gets a 4xx rather than a 500 — a taken username is `409 Username already exists`, an id that points at nothing is `400`, a value too long or too large for its column is `400`.

### Auth

The refresh token is **not** in the response body. It is set as a cookie the browser keeps and JavaScript cannot read: `HttpOnly; Path=/api/v1/auth` (and `Secure` in production). `SameSite` is `none` under `ENV=production`, where the frontend and the API sit on different sites, and `strict` otherwise; `REFRESH_COOKIE_SAMESITE` overrides it. Browser clients send these calls with credentials.

| Method | Route               | Auth | Description                          |
| ------ | ------------------- | ---- | ------------------------------------ |
| POST   | `/auth/register`    | No   | Register — returns `{ user, accessToken }`, sets the refresh cookie |
| POST   | `/auth/login`       | No   | Log in — same shape; a wrong username and a wrong password answer identically |
| POST   | `/auth/demo`        | No   | Sign in as the shared demo customer (`DEMO_USERNAME`) — no body; `404` when switched off, missing, or not a `customer` |
| POST   | `/auth/refresh`     | Cookie | New access token and a rotated cookie — presenting an already-used token revokes that whole session |
| POST   | `/auth/logout`      | Cookie | End that session and clear the cookie |
| POST   | `/auth/logout-all`  | JWT  | End every session of the account     |
| GET    | `/auth/me`          | JWT  | The signed-in account                |

### Roles

Every account has a `role`: `customer` (default) or `admin`. Self-registration always creates a customer; a `role` in the register or update body is ignored. Admins are created by `npm run seed:admin`, `POST /admin/users` or `PUT /admin/users/:id/role`.

Customer routes serve the token's **own** account only — another account's id answers 403 (users, addresses) or 404 (orders, cart items). That holds for an admin's token too: cross-account work belongs to `/admin`, where the role is re-read from the database on every request.

### Users

| Method | Route                  | Auth | Description                              |
| ------ | ---------------------- | ---- | ---------------------------------------- |
| GET    | `/users/:id`           | JWT  | Own account, with recent purchases — 403 for any other id |
| PATCH  | `/users/:id`           | JWT  | Own profile (`firstName`, `lastName`, `username`) — at least one |
| PUT    | `/users/:id/password`  | JWT  | Change own password: needs `currentPassword`; ends every other session and returns a fresh session |
| DELETE | `/users/:id`           | JWT  | Close own account: profile scrubbed, addresses and cart deleted, sessions ended, orders kept |

### Products

Read-only, and limited to products on sale. Managing the catalog is an admin function under `/admin/products`.

| Method | Route                  | Auth | Description                              |
| ------ | ---------------------- | ---- | ---------------------------------------- |
| GET    | `/products`            | JWT  | Catalog (paginated; `?category=` exact, `?search=` name or description — both case-insensitive) |
| GET    | `/products/categories` | JWT  | Every category on sale, sorted           |
| GET    | `/products/popular`    | JWT  | Five most bought products, counting completed orders only |
| GET    | `/products/:id`        | JWT  | One product on sale (an archived one answers 404) |

### Orders

Checkout is the only way a customer creates an order, and orders are read-only for customers afterwards.

| Method | Route                  | Auth | Description                      |
| ------ | ---------------------- | ---- | -------------------------------- |
| GET    | `/orders`              | JWT  | Own orders, newest first, with totals (paginated; `?status=`) |
| GET    | `/orders/:id`          | JWT  | Own order — someone else's answers 404 |
| GET    | `/orders/:id/products` | JWT  | Lines of an own order, each with the price paid |

### Cart

| Method | Route             | Auth | Description                                      |
| ------ | ----------------- | ---- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| GET    | `/cart`           | JWT  | Own cart, each row with its product              |
| POST   | `/cart`           | JWT  | Add `productId`, optional `typeId` and `quantity` — the same product and option again adds up (max 999). Price, option and shop come from the product |
| POST   | `/cart/checkout`  | JWT  | Buy the rows named by `cartItemIds`: quantities from the cart, price and stock from the product, stock reduced, price stored on each line, rows bought leave the cart. All or nothing |
| PATCH  | `/cart/:id`       | JWT  | Change a row's quantity                          |
| DELETE | `/cart/:id`       | JWT  | Remove a row                                     |
| DELETE | `/cart`           | JWT  | Empty the cart                                   |

Checkout answers `409` and changes nothing when a product was archived, an option is gone, stock is short, or a row is no longer in the cart.

### Addresses

| Method | Route             | Auth | Description          |
| ------ | ----------------- | ---- | -------------------- |
| GET    | `/addresses`      | JWT  | Own addresses, default first |
| GET    | `/addresses/:id`  | JWT  | One own address      |
| POST   | `/addresses`      | JWT  | Save an address; the first one becomes the default |
| PATCH  | `/addresses/:id`  | JWT  | Change an address — at least one field |
| DELETE | `/addresses/:id`  | JWT  | Delete an address; deleting the default hands it to the oldest one left |

### Page views

| Method | Route         | Auth | Description |
| ------ | ------------- | ---- | ----------- |
| POST   | `/page-views` | JWT  | Report a page the user opened (`path`, optional `page` name). Stored in `page_views`, not in the audit log |

### Admin

All routes require an admin token, and the role is re-read from the database on every request. List routes are paginated. Admin reads of account data are recorded in the audit log.

| Method | Route                          | Description                                   |
| ------ | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| GET    | `/admin/users`                 | Every open account                            |
| GET    | `/admin/users/:id`             | One account, with recent purchases            |
| POST   | `/admin/users`                 | Create an account; optional `role`            |
| PATCH  | `/admin/users/:id`             | Profile fields of any account                 |
| PUT    | `/admin/users/:id/role`        | Set `customer` / `admin`; ends that account's sessions; not on self |
| PUT    | `/admin/users/:id/password`    | Reset a password without the old one; ends that account's sessions |
| DELETE | `/admin/users/:id`             | Close an account (scrub + keep orders); not on self |
| GET    | `/admin/products`              | Every product, archived ones included (`?category=` `?search=`) |
| POST   | `/admin/products`              | Add a product                                 |
| POST   | `/admin/products/bulk`         | Add 1–500 products in one transaction         |
| GET    | `/admin/products/:id`          | One product, archived or not                  |
| PATCH  | `/admin/products/:id`          | Change a product; `isActive: true` puts an archived one back on sale |
| DELETE | `/admin/products/:id`          | Archive a product (`isActive: false`) — the row stays, so past orders keep it |
| GET    | `/admin/orders`                | Every order (`?status=` `?userId=`)           |
| POST   | `/admin/orders`                | Open an order for `userId`                    |
| GET    | `/admin/orders/:id`            | Any order                                     |
| PATCH  | `/admin/orders/:id`            | Change an order's status                      |
| DELETE | `/admin/orders/:id`            | Delete an order and its lines                 |

| GET    | `/admin/audit-logs`            | Audit log, newest first (`?userId=` `?username=` `?action=` `?result=` `?from=` `?to=`); read-only |
| GET    | `/admin/page-views`            | Page views, newest first (`?userId=` `?username=` `?path=` `?from=` `?to=`); read-only |

**Auth header:** protected routes require `Authorization: Bearer <accessToken>`. Access tokens are HS256 JWTs (any other algorithm is rejected) and expire after 15 minutes by default.

### audit_logs

Security-relevant events. `user_id` has no foreign key and the username is copied in, so entries outlive a closed account. Rows older than `AUDIT_LOG_RETENTION_DAYS` (default 90) are deleted daily.

### page_views
